## Project Brief: Build a Responsive Image Gallery
### Overview
Your task is to create a responsive image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery should allow users to view and interact with a set of images in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.

### Requirements
Use HTML and CSS to create the layout of the gallery. The gallery should have a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.

Use JavaScript to create functionality for the gallery. Users should be able to:

1. Click on an image to view it in a larger size or in a lightbox overlay.
2. Navigate through the gallery using arrow buttons or swipe gestures.
3. Use pagination or infinite scrolling to view more images.

Implement best practices for performance and accessibility. The gallery should load quickly and be usable by people with disabilities.

Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your codebase and submit your code in a repository.

### Bonus Features
If you have time, you can add some extra features to make your gallery more interesting and engaging, such as:

1. Filter or sort images based on tags or categories.
2. Add animations or transitions to improve the user experience.
3. Allow users to upload their own images to the gallery.

### Evaluation Criteria

1. Code quality and organization.
2. Use of modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques.
3. Responsiveness and cross-device compatibility.
